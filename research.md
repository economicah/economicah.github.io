["Black Gold: The Effect of Wealth on Descendents of the Enslaved"](http://micahvillarreal.com/MV_jmp_2025_latest.pdf)

_This paper examines how short-term wealth shocks affected the economic trajectories of descendants of the enslaved in the early twentieth-century United States. I exploit a natural experiment in which Creek Freedmen allottees—Black landholders in Oklahoma—received quasi-random windfalls when producing oil wells were drilled on their land allotments. By constructing and linking microdata from the Dawes Rolls, allotment maps, oil drilling records, and U.S. censuses from 1910 to 1940, I show that oil discoveries were as-good-as-random with respect to pre-treatment characteristics. The wealth shocks had modest direct effects on asset accumulation, but large and persistent impacts on human capital. Treated youths were less likely to work, more likely to remain in school, and ultimately attained higher levels of education. Over subsequent decades, they shifted toward white-collar occupations, urban residence, and—by 1940—higher rates of homeownership. These findings provide the first causal evidence on the long-run effects of wealth shocks for descendants of the enslaved. They suggest that wealth enabled strategic investments in education and mobility, generating lasting socioeconomic gains despite ongoing racial barriers._

"Last Place Aversion in the Jim Crow South." (draft available upon request)
_I explore whether variation in the aggregate status of nonwhite Americans relative to white Americans in the Jim Crow South has a relationship with racist sentiments, as proxied by Ku Klux Klan (KKK) activity. I report some estimates of the relationship between three possible measures of relative status and KKK activity at a county level. I am agnostic to the reasons why county level, home ownership rate and income of white and nonwhite people vary between place and over time, instead taking them as given. I find that there is a strong and positive relationship between nonwhite income and KKK activity. I propose that such a relationship could be explained by “last-place aversion” on the part of poor white Southerners._
