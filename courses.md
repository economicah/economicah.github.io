**Selected Student Feedback**
"Micah is absolutely excellent at explaining complex concepts from this course in a simple and effective manner... Micah's [section] is by far the best in terms of clarity and concision... Without her explanations, I would not have done as well in this course!" - Econ 140A Student

"I really liked how Micah genuinely cared about the success of her students, and would go out of her way to explain a concept to you... Overall, one of the better TAs I have learned from." - Econ 140A Student
