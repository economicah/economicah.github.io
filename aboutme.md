I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I conduct applied economic research related to labor, gender, race and inequality.

Prior to joining UCSB, I was a programmer at Abt Associates, Inc. where I conducted research on labor and housing policy. I was also a research assistant for Esther Duflo at J-PAL, MIT. I hold a B.A. in International Relations & Economics from Wellesley College.
