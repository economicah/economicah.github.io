I am a Candidate for a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I am spending Fall 2023 at the Department of Economics at Northwestern University. I conduct applied economic research related to labor, gender, race and inequality.

Prior to starting at UCSB, I was a programmer at [Abt Associates, Inc.](https://www.abtassociates.com/) where I conducted research on labor and housing policy. I was also a research assistant at [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/). I hold a B.A. in International Relations & Economics from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/).
